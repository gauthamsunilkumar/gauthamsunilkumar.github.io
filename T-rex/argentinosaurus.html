        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>When it was discovered in Argentina in 1987, Argentinosaurus, the world's biggest dinosaur, shook the world of paleontology to its foundations. 

            Ever since its discovery, paleontologists have argued about the length and weight of Argentinosaurus. Some reconstructions put this dinosaur at 75 to 85 feet from head to tail and up to 75 tons, while others are less restrained, positing (somewhat less credibly) a total length of 100 feet and a weight of a whopping 100 tons. 
            
            If the latter estimates hold, that would make Argentinosarus the biggest dinosaur on record based on well-attested fossil evidence.</p>

        <h3>Time Period it Lived in</h3>
        <p>Argentinosaurus is a genus of giant sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period in what is now Argentina. Although it is only known from fragmentary remains, Argentinosaurus is one of the largest known land animals of all time, perhaps the largest, reaching 30–35 metres (98–115 ft) in length and 60–75 tonnes (66–83 short tons) in body mass. It was a member of Titanosauria, the dominant group of sauropods during the Cretaceous.</p>

            <h3>Strengths of the Argentinosaurus</h3>
            <p>Argentinosaurus is among the largest known land animals, although its exact size is difficult to estimate because of the incompleteness of its remains.[8] To counter this problem, palaeontologists can compare the known material with that of smaller related sauropods known from more complete remains. The more complete taxon can then be scaled up to match the dimensions of Argentinosaurus. Mass can be estimated from known relationships between certain bone measurements and body mass, or through determining the volume of models.</p>

            <h3>What did the Argentinosaurus eat</h3>
            <p>Argentinosaurus was an herbivore. This large sauropod had good teeth for grinding and chewing the tough plant material found in Cretaceous period Argentina.

                Some biologists believe that dinosaurs, particularly this large Argentinosaurus, were able to reach such a massive size due to the rate of their metabolism. It is thought that at the height of adolescence an Argentinosaurus would have been able to gain roughly 100 pounds per day – That’s a lot of plant matter!
