        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Sarcosuchus was a prehistoric crocodile which lived approximately 112 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous Period. It was first discovered during the 1950s in Aoulef, Algeria and Gara Kamboute, Tunisia by a team led by French paleontologist Albert-Félix de Lapparent. In 1964, a complete skull of Sacosuchus was discovered in Gadoufaoua, Niger and promptly sent to Paris for further study. This skull would become the holotype of the species. It was also given its name, a name which means “flesh crocodile” in Greek.</p>

            <h3>Strengths of the Sarcosuchus</h3>
            <p>Sarcosuchus was approximately 40 feet long – or about the size of a whale shark – and weighed about 15 tons, which is about 7 tons heavier than an elephant! That would have made it large enough to defend its territory from some of the theropods that may have existed at the time.</p>

            <h3>Weaknesses of the Sarcosuchus</h3>
            <p>One of the most interesting facts about Sarcosuchus, however, wasn’t its enormous size but its eyes. It appears that its eyes didn’t move left and right but instead moved up and down. This means that it spent quite a bit of time submerged below the surface of the water. Therefore, it’s quite likely that it hunted in the same way as modern crocodiles do today.</p>
