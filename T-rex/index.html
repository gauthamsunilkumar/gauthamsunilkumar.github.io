        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Tyrannosaurus Rex also known as T Rex was one of the largest meat-eating Dinosaurs that ever lived. Everything about this ferocious predator, from its thick, heavy skull to its 4-foot-long (1.2-meter-long) jaw, was designed for maximum bone-crushing action.

            It lived during the Late Cretaceous period, more specifically the Maastrichtian Age (or if you want it in biological terms, the Lancian Age), which was between 68 and 66 million years ago. That would make it a contemporary of dinosaurs like Triceratops and Ornithomimus.</p>

            <h3>Strengths of the T-rex</h3>
            <p>Trex Strength The flexural stress of Trex is 250 psi for a 3-inch board, and 600 psi for Baluster. Tensile strength (the pressure it take to shear or snap the material) is 250 and 350 for 3-inch Trex board and Baluster respectively.</p>

            <h3>Weaknesses of the T-rex</h3>
            <p>The only apparent weakness was its forearms, which are not even long enough to reach its mouth, but they probably could have been used for grabbing preyâ€¦ or at least pieces of it. It was suggested at some point that T Rex was covered with feathers, or at least some protofeathers, but this theory was proven inaccurate.</p>

            <h3>What did the T-rex eat</h3>
            <p>T. rex was a huge carnivore and primarily ate herbivorous dinosaurs, including Edmontosaurus and Triceratops. The predator acquired its food through scavenging and hunting, grew incredibly fast and ate hundreds of pounds at a time, said University of Kansas paleontologist David Burnham.</p>
