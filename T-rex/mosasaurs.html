        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Mosasaurs are a group of marine lizards that would have lived in the Badlands area from about 75-69 million years ago. When they were alive, mosasaurs could reach lengths of up to 50 feet, which is roughly the length of a bus! Mosasaurs were top predators of the world’s oceans and would eat anything they could catch.

            The modern relatives of mosasaurs are snakes and monitor lizards, both of which live on land. When mosasaurs evolved from a terrestrial lifestyle to a marine one, they developed webbed paddles for swimming. Early mosasaur ancestors probably weren’t fully marine like a true mosasaur – it’s likely that they fed in shallow coastal waters, only returning to land for resting and breeding like iguanas do today. Mosasaurs, like their relatives, were scaled. Their scales were slightly smaller than those of the prairie rattlesnake, an animal which lives in Badlands National Park today.</p>

            <h3>Weaknesses of the Mosasaurs</h3>
            <p>Mosasaurs were huge animals, and they needed to eat in order to sustain their huge size. Paleontologists have discovered the preserved remains of mosasaur stomachs which contain food like fish, sharks, cephalopods, birds, and even other mosasaurs. It’s likely that mosasaurs weren’t picky and would eat pretty much anything which could fit into their enormous mouths – which, it turns out, was a lot.</p>

            <h3>What did the Mosasaurs eat</h3>
            <p>These creatures spent much of their time hunting, but they also had to worry about being hunted. There’s not much that could have preyed upon this gigantic creature, but bite marks and mangled paddles of fossil mosasaurs suggest that mosasaurs often fought (and ate) each other. Young mosasaurs also had to avoid predators like sharks and giant predatory fish.</p>
