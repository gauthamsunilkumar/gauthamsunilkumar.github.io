        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Carcharodontosaurus was a carnivore that lived in the Cretaceous period and inhabited Africa.</p>

            <h3>Strengths of the Carcharodontosaurus</h3>
            <p>Carcharodontosaurus had a huge skull that measured 5 feet long. It grew to be about 13.1 meters long, 3.9 meters tall, and 7-7.5 tons in weight. It had long muscular legs, and fossilized footprints indicated it could run at 20 miles per hour. He said that Carcharodontosaurus had a good sense of smell, more so than modern dogs today. However, its vision was not as clear because its eyes were in its head rather than straight ahead.</p>

            <h3>Weaknesses of the Carcharodontosaurus</h3>
            <p>Although Carcharodontosaurus was a large dinosaur, it is still not equal to or more gigantic than the deadly T. Rex. Recent studies show that Carcharodontosaurus was a couple of tons less than the largest specimens of T. Rex.</p>

            <h3>What did the Carcharodontosaurus eat</h3>
            <p>It was a giant dinosaur that hunted giant sauropods. This huge shark-toothed lizard was one of the giant theropods along with Saurophaganax and Bahariasaurus. It was distinguished by its elongated snout and an assortment of spikes located along its back and head. Its jaws were equipped with sharp serrated teeth that closely resembled the teeth of a great white shark and could cut through prey flesh like sharp blades.</p>
